// Having to subclass this is annoying. I had a ComposedPasteboardWriter where you could do
// ComposedPastboardWriter(writers: [filePromiseProvider, url as NSURL]), which seemed to work,
// however when using it, the drag pasteboard was missing the dyn.* types ("Apple files promise
// pasteboard type" and "NSPromiseContentsPboardType) as well as
// com.apple.pasteboard.promised-file-url. I don't know if that actually broke file promises, but
// I didn't want to mess with it.
